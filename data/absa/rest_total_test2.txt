The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.####The=O presentation=O of=O Snooze=T-POS is=O excellent=O and=O it=O is=O one=O of=O those=O places=O that=O you=O feel=O more=O sophisticated=O just=O for=O being=O there=O ;=O but=O peel=O back=O the=O layers=O and=O you=O have=O an=O overpriced=O IHOP=O with=O a=O high=O brow=O menu=T-NEG .=O

The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.####The=O pancakes=T-POS were=O certainly=O inventive=O but=O $=O 850=O for=O 3=O ,=O 6=O pancakes=T-POS one=O of=O them=O was=O more=O like=O 5=O in=O the=O pancake=O flight=O sample=O of=O 3=O different=O pancakes=T-POS is=O well=O over-priced=O .=O

Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.####Ray=O 's=O is=O something=O of=O a=O Seattle=O institution=O ,=O but=O given=O its=O gorgeous=O Sound=T-POS views=T-POS ,=O I=O had=O suspected=O that=O the=O accolades=O were=O more=O due=O to=O the=O scenery=O than=O to=O the=O food=O and=O service=O .=O
