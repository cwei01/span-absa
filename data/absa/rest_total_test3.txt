The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.####The=O service=T-NEG ,=O however=O ,=O is=O a=O peg=O or=O two=O below=O the=O quality=T-POS of=T-POS food=T-POS horrible=O bartenders=T-NEG ,=O and=O the=O clientele=T-NEG ,=O for=O the=O most=O part=O ,=O are=O rowdy=O ,=O loud-mouthed=O commuters=O this=O could=O explain=O the=O bad=O attitudes=O from=O the=O staff=T-NEG getting=O loaded=O for=O an=O AC/DC=O concert=O or=O a=O Knicks=O game=O .=O

The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.####The=O new=T-POS menu=T-POS has=O a=O few=O creative=O items=O ,=O they=O were=O smart=O enough=O to=O keep=O some=O of=O the=O old=O favorites=O but=O they=O raised=O the=O prices=T-NEG ,=O the=O staff=O is=O friendly=O most=O of=O the=O time=O ,=O but=O I=O must=O agree=O with=O the=O person=O that=O wrote=O about=O their=O favorite=O words=O ,=O No=O ,=O ca=O n't=O ,=O sorry=O ,=O boy=O ,=O they=O wo=O n't=O bend=O the=O rules=O for=O anyone=O .=O

To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.####To=O top=O it=O all=O off=O the=O main=O reason=O we=O came=O to=O your=O restaurant=O was=O for=O the=O belly=O dancers=O and=O missed=O the=O first=O show=O as=O we=O were=O not=O seated=O yet=O and=O the=O 2nd=O belly=O dancer=O only=O danced=O at=O two=O tables=O in=O the=O back=O of=O the=O restaurant=O and=O never=O made=O it=O around=O to=O the=O other=O half=O of=O the=O restaurant=O .=O

However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.####However=O ,=O once=O I=O received=O my=O predictably=O mediocre=O order=O of=O what=O Dokebi=O thinks=O passes=O as=O Korean=T-NEG fair=T-NEG ,=O sometimes=O you=O have=O to=O settle=O when=O it=O 's=O your=O only=O option=O ,=O I=O got=O through=O about=O half=O my=O kimchee=T-NEG before=O I=O found=O a=O piece=O of=O random=O lettuce=O accompanied=O by=O a=O far=O more=O disgusting=O ,=O slimy=O ,=O clearly=O bad=O piece=O of=O fish=O skin=O .=O
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.####My=O main=O concern=O was=O the=O sanity=O of=O the=O food=T-NEG that=O was=O being=O sent=O out=O to=O myself=O and=O others=O ,=O but=O I=O would=O be=O lying=O is=O I=O said=O that=O as=O someone=O who=O has=O worked=O in=O restaurants=O since=O the=O age=O of=O fifteen=O I=O was=O expecting=O at=O least=O a=O minimal=O effort=O on=O the=O part=O of=O the=O restaurant=O to=O amend=O the=O situation=O .=O
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.####My=O girlfriend=O ,=O being=O slightly=O more=O aggressive=O ,=O and=O having=O been=O equally=O disgusted=O causing=O her=O to=O throw=O out=O the=O remainder=O of=O her=O barely=O eaten=O meal=T-NEG ,=O called=O back=O only=O to=O be=O informed=O that=O I=O was=O probably=O wrong=O and=O that=O it=O was=O most=O likely=O an=O oyster=O ,=O and=O that=O we=O were=O also=O blacklisted=O from=O their=O restaurant=O .=O

There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. ####There=O 's=O another=O girl=T-NEG who=O I=O ca=O n't=O describe=O ,=O she=O is=O about=O 5'6=O with=O brown=O hair=O ,=O who=O eavesdrops=O on=O your=O conversation=O and=O chimes=O in=O ,=O except=O she=O only=O hears=O the=O last=O part=O of=O what=O you=O said=O ,=O so=O her=O uninvited=O opinions=O are=O often=O out=O of=O context=O and=O nothing=O to=O do=O with=O what=O you=O 're=O *really*=O talking=O about=O .=O
