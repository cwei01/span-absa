One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables.####One=O more=O thing=O ,=O this=O mac=O does=O NOT=O come=O with=O restore=T-NEG disks=T-NEG and=O I=O am=O not=O sure=O if=O you=O can=O make=O them=O direct=O from=O the=O mac=O like=O you=O can=O with=O newer=O PC=O 's=O ,=O also=O the=O charging=T-NEG cables=T-NEG are=O made=O of=O the=O same=O cheap=O material=T-NEG as=O the=O iPhone/iPod=O touch=O cables=O .=O
My last laptop was a 17" ASUS gaming machine, which performed admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago.####My=O last=O laptop=O was=O a=O 17=O ASUS=O gaming=O machine=O ,=O which=O performed=T-POS admirably=O ,=O but=O having=O since=O built=O my=O own=O desktop=O and=O really=O settling=O into=O the=O college=O life=O ,=O I=O found=O myself=O wanting=O something=O smaller=O and=O less=O cumbersome=O ,=O not=O to=O mention=O that=O the=O ASUS=O had=O been=O slowly=O developing=O problems=O ever=O since=O I=O bought=O it=O about=O 4=O years=O ago=O .=O
If you get a lemon (I have two thirds of my  Macs), you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it, even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers.####If=O you=O get=O a=O lemon=O I=O have=O two=O thirds=O of=O my=O Macs=O ,=O you=O have=O to=O send=O it=O in=O for=O repairs=O several=O times=O before=O they=O will=O replace=O it=O ,=O even=O if=O they=O have=O numerous=O problems=O with=O the=O same=O version=O of=O their=O computers=O .=O
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $900+ level only, and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU (similar to the $799 Mini), with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card (this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card), and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse, all put together in neat and nice package.####The=O Like=O New=O condition=O of=O the=O iMac=O MC309LL/A=O on=O Amazon=O is=O at=O $=O 900+=O level=O only=O ,=O and=O it=O is=O a=O Quad-Core=T-NEU 2.5=T-NEU GHz=T-NEU CPU=T-NEU similar=O to=O the=O $=O 799=O Mini=O ,=O with=O Radeon=T-NEU HD=T-NEU 6750M=T-NEU 512MB=T-NEU graphic=T-NEU card=T-NEU this=O mini=O is=O integrated=T-NEU Intel=T-NEU 4000=T-NEU card=T-NEU ,=O and=O it=O even=O comes=O with=O wireless=T-NEU Apple=T-NEU Keyboard=T-NEU and=T-NEU Mouse=T-NEU ,=O all=O put=O together=O in=O neat=O and=O nice=O package=T-POS .=O
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install, but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu.####I=O like=O the=O Mini=O Mac=O it=O was=O easy=O to=O setup=T-POS and=O install=T-POS ,=O but=O I=O am=O learning=O as=O I=O go=O and=O could=O use=O a=O tutorial=T-NEU to=O learn=O how=O to=O use=O some=O of=O the=O features=T-NEU I=O was=O use=O to=O on=O the=O PC=O especially=O the=O right=T-NEU mouse=T-NEU click=T-NEU menu=T-NEU .=O
Additionally, there is barely a ventilation system in the computer, and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot, and in fact impossible to keep on lap.####Additionally=O ,=O there=O is=O barely=O a=O ventilation=T-NEG system=T-NEG in=O the=O computer=O ,=O and=O even=O the=O simple=O activity=O of=O watching=T-NEU videos=T-NEU let=O alone=O playing=T-NEU steam=T-NEU games=T-NEU causes=O the=O laptop=O to=O get=O very=O very=O hot=O ,=O and=O in=O fact=O impossible=O to=O keep=O on=O lap=O .=O
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it, as I am old school and hate the pad, but knew that before I bought it, now it works great, need to get adjusted to the key board, as I am used to a bigger one and pounding.####I=O had=O to=O buy=O a=O wireless=T-NEU mouse=T-NEU to=O go=O with=O it=O ,=O as=O I=O am=O old=O school=O and=O hate=O the=O pad=T-NEG ,=O but=O knew=O that=O before=O I=O bought=O it=O ,=O now=O it=O works=T-POS great=O ,=O need=O to=O get=O adjusted=O to=O the=O key=T-NEU board=T-NEU ,=O as=O I=O am=O used=O to=O a=O bigger=O one=O and=O pounding=O .=O
